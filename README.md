This all came about when I started Microsoft's GitHub training courses.

Realistically, there's no need to make a repo just for Hello World projects (if they can be called projects)

But I decided I might as well populate the repo with Hello World programs for every language I know as a way of keeping track of them. This was especially useful for Java and C, which are more complex languages
than the JavaScript I'd been practicing and Python I was already proficient in. Indeed, it had been a while since I'd programmed in either language, and I'd forgotten the subtleties of the two that aren't found
in other languages (such as needing to write main functions)

When I was then given a Hello World project during a React course, I decided it would be a good idea to add it here, for posterity. As this has now made this repository ~50% JavaScript, I have come to regret this. To compensate, I will next be using turtle.py
